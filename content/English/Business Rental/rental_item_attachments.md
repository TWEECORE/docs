If you want to track which accessories you have handed over to the customer for your rental items, you can use this function in Business Rental. The use is optional.

Open any rental item and select Rental Item Attachments. A corresponding table will open. Here you can define the items that should be handed over again after the rental.

For certain accessories, it may be useful to set the setup to "non inventory".

If you do not receive the accessories back in full at the end of the rental, you can charge the customer for the item.
